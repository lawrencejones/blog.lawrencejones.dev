My personal blog, collating the material I've authored over my career. Currently
most links will link to Medium articles for a better editing and sharing
experience.

Merging to master triggers CircleCI to deploy any changes. The site is hosted
using Google Cloud Storage with Cloudflare for DNS and SSL.
