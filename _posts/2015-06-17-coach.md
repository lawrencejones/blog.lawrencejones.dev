  <p>
    Today we're open sourcing Coach, a library that removes the complexity from
    Rails controllers. Bundle your shared behaviour into highly robust, heavily
    tested middlewares and rely on Coach to join them together, providing static
    analysis over the entire chain. Coach ensures you only require a glance to
    see what's being run on each controller endpoint.
